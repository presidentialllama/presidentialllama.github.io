                    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
                    (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread
                    worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8] Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough,
                    headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one to
                    fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable
                    symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild
                    to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung
                    involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15]
                    Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects
                    (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to
                    further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16]" (Wikipedia)
